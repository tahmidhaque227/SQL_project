Here’s an analysis of the top-paying skills for Data Engineer roles:

Programming skills like Node, Rust, and Clojure bring the highest salaries, showing demand for modern and high-performance languages.

Big data and database tools such as Mongo, Cassandra, and Kafka remain core to data engineering roles.

Cloud and DevOps tools (e.g., Kubernetes, CodeCommit, Ubuntu) are essential for managing scalable data pipelines.

Data science–related tools like ggplot2, NumPy, and OpenCV highlight overlap between data engineering and analytics.

Specialized or niche skills — including Solidity and GDPR — offer premium pay due to their limited expertise in the market.
